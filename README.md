# Bash The Ballot

This project is built for Hack the Valley 2 and has won the Best Use of the ConsenSys API.

Bash The Ballot is a React voting platform that tackles the issues of fraud and identity theft. It uses uPort to verify the users' identities and prevent them from voting twice.

The current web app is a simulation of an election in the fictional town of Birdtown, where the candidates are - unsurprisingly - all birds. The user can consult election statistics on the home page, which displays a pie chart with the real-time number of votes for each candidate, as shown below.

The user votes through a html form and, after submitting his or her choice, the user is prompted to verify his or her identity through uPort (QR), where the user confirms personal information.

## Prospects and Benefits

We believe that the Bash The Ballot platform can be used not only for elections, but for any event requiring an audience to vote, such as policy voting.

Bash The Ballot improves transparency and voters' trust during a voting process through the power of blockchain and can encourage a greater number of participants.
